    A Bachelor's degree that prepares you for reality
  </h1>

  <div>Studying at CODE will be unlike any other higher-education experience. As a student, you will not be confronted with pre-selected knowledge but empowered to be a creative problem-solver who knows how to learn.

    Become a Software Engineer, Interaction Designer or Product Manager

  <p>
    We believe that the most effective way to learn is not by passively absorbing selected facts and ready-made content to reproduce for the next exam. That’s where curiosity-driven education comes into play. As part of an interdisciplinary learning experience, many modules offered by one of our three programs are also credited towards the other two.
