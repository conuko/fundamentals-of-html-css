      As part of the Northern Silk Road running northwest from the western section of the Ordos Loop between Yinchuan
      and Lanzhou, the Hexi Corridor was the most important trade route in Northwest China, linking China proper to the
      historic Western Regions for traders and military incursions into Central Asia. It is a string of oases along the
      northern edges of the Qilian Mountains and Altyn-Tagh, with the high and desolate Tibetan Plateau further to the
      south. To the north are the Longshou, Heli and Mazong Mountains separating it from the arid Badain Jaran Desert,
      Gobi Desert and the cold steppes of the Mongolian Plateau. At the western end, the route splits into three, going
      either north of the Tianshan Mountains or south on either side of the Tarim Basin. At the eastern end, the
      mountains around Lanzhou grants access to the Longxi Basin, which leads east through Mount Long along the Wei
      River valley into the populous Guanzhong Plain, and then into the Central Plain.
